# Donut

The implementation of **Donut** relies on two important libraries: Zhusuan and TFsnippet. Once installed, you can proceed to install the Donut package itself. More information about how to set up the working environment can be found on the official repository: https://github.com/haowen-xu/donut.

For more details about the model, you can refer to the original paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03903.
